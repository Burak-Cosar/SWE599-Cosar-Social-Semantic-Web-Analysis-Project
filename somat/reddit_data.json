        "title": "Financials of the Big 3 - a basic analysis",
        "body": "**Hi everyone!**   \n  \nFinancial results for Q1 2024 were shared in our GS sub, and the reactions prompted me to make a quick post about this. There is a summary/TLDR at the bottom if you want to skip the text, though.   \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice. Never listen to some random person on Reddit who could be lying about everything. Thx &lt;3\n\n  \nPeople were kinda panicking because all our clubs are reaching record debt levels. The situation isn't all that bad, actually. However, it\u2019s basically impossible to understand what the h\\*\\*\\* is going on when clubs just throw out huge numbers like \u201cwe are X gajillion in debt\u201d without having studied finance. So, let\u2019s analyze the numbers a little.  \n\n\n# About Me (feel free to skip)\n\nMy Turkish sucks, but I have a background in a very niche area of investment finance, analyzing company financials and making investment decisions for a living. I\u2019ve done this for funds worth more than the combined value of the three clubs. I've also studied finance with reasonable success. There are surely better people here to look at public financials (my focus being private, and not in T\u00fcrkiye), but let me kick it off, and you guys can correct me as we go. I don\u2019t see enough data-driven financial discussions, yet I constantly hear \u201cbut X cannot afford Y,\u201d so let\u2019s change that.\n\n\n\n# What I Don\u2019t Know\n\n* Any deals and data not provided in the KAP financial summaries. If you know where to find more/better info, LMK.\n* Details of refinancing agreements and interest rates.\n* What \"Bankalar Birli\u011fi\" even means in practice - I understand there is an agreement with banks that some proportion of debt is covered by some proportion of net income? Feel free to add info here and correct me.\n* A lot of other stuff in general but let's not talk about that \n\n\n\nMy sources are the Excel sheets downloaded from KAP. For example, Galatasaray\u2019s data can be found here:  \n[https://www.kap.org.tr/en/sirket-finansal-bilgileri/4028e4a14203278a0142095598f114ba](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/sirket-finansal-bilgileri/4028e4a14203278a0142095598f114ba)\n\n  \n\n\n# OK LETS START - Key Numbers to Focus On\n\n\n\n# 1. Liability-to-Asset Ratios\n\nIn simple terms, liabilities are what clubs owe and assets are what clubs have. A ratio above 1 indicates that a club owes more than it has, which is OK in some (very few) situations but unsustainable in the long run.\n\n\n\n|Year|GS|FB|BJK|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2021**|137%|136%|202%|\n|**2022**|138%|134%|198%|\n|**2023**|95%|113%|147%|\n|**2024Q1**|95%|104%|130%|\n\n**Trend**:\n\n* **Overall**: the TREND is POSITIVE. All clubs are deleveraging. This is what we would expect: interest rates go up, \"cost of debt\" (i.e. how expensive it is to take a loan) increases, so clubs reduce the % of their financing through debt. The overall amount of debt is quite high though. \n* **GS**: Improved significantly from 2021 - only club with positive Equity i.e. less total liabilities than total assets. While it's the healthiest of the 3, 95% is still crazy high. \n* **FB**: The ratio remains above 100%, nevertheless improving slowly but steadily. \n* **BJK**: Still leveraged up to the \\*\\*\\*\\* (are we allowed to say that word here?), but it has improved **MASSIVELY**. Holy smokes BJK, well done. But also, you guys are so overleveraged, Im surprised you managed to avoid bankruptcy. Keep up the good work though. \n\n  \nNote that it's quite expected that clubs have high debt. Interest rates in Turkey were low while the currency was in inflation. Financing old debt with new debt and taking on loans for new investments makes a lot of sense. Nevertheless, it'd be a stretch to say our clubs are financially stable and (without having calculated ideal values) I feel like the goal should be to get closer to 70% than 130%. Tech companies with uncertain cash flows tend to aim for 20ish-50ish % depending on the relative cost of debt and equity. Over 100 kinda blows my mind. \n\n\n\n# 2. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Debt\n\nOK so I already hinted at the fact that looking at total liabilities alone does not paint the whole picture. There are low interest loans and high interest loans, short term debt and long term debt. For simplicity, we'll assume that short term debt is recent and at higher interest rates. Thus, more expensive. Shortterm debt is also more dangerous because it needs to be paid back soon. Can't pay and you have a big oopsie. So what are good numbers here? You want long-term rather than short-term debt and you hope that the proportion of short-term is generally DECREASING.   \n\n\n|Year|GS (Short/Long)|FB (Short/Long)|BJK (Short/Long)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2021**|1.59B / 2.59B|1.48B / 3.42B|1.20B / 3.58B|\n|**2022**|4.50B / 3.04B|2.87B / 3.29B|1.74B / 4.14B|\n|**2023**|6.44B / 4.16B|5.93B / 3.45B|4.45B / 5.03B|\n|**2024Q1**|9.30B / 4.94B|9.64B / 3.42B|5.93B / 4.49B|\n\n  \n**Overall**: Kinda meh, to not say very bad. Clubs are still taking on a lot of debt and even more so now. Why? God knows. Is it the race between FB and GS that seems to have reached new highs? But debt is really expensive right now so that's not a great look. N.B.: these are not in real terms, they're not adjusted for inflation. So look at ratios more than the figures. \n\n* **GS**: Not great, thats a lot of new debt. As we will discuss later, GS does not have a lot of liquid reserves to pay off this debt. \n* **FB**: Same as GS, just worse. Almost doubled short-term debt. What's costing you guys so much? On the upside, FB has more liquid assets as we will discuss later. \n* **BJK**: Healthiest proportion of short-term vs long-term debt. But you guys shouldn't be taking on new debt unless your lives depends on it so... hm. We know that later on you guys go for Immobile and Rafa. \n\n  \n\n\n**3. Revenues**\n\nOK so we looked at debt. Next, we obviously need to look at the top line and see how much money is coming in. Little disclaimer here, it would be great to look at a more detailed breakdown of earnings but the KAP statements does not provide that - if anyone has more info, please share. \n\n\n\n|Year|Galatasaray (GS)|Fenerbah\u00e7e (FB)|Be\u015fikta\u015f (BJK)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2021**|1.19 billion TL|1.30 billion TL|987 million TL|\n|**2022**|1.76 billion TL|2.06 billion TL|1.33 billion TL|\n|**2023**|7.95 billion TL|5.52 billion TL|3.43 billion TL|\n|**2024 Q1**|1.89 billion TL|1.33 billion TL|1.13 billion TL|\n\n**Trend**:\n\n* **Overall**: Very positive. All clubs are improving their upside. \n* **GS**: Significant improvement in 2023, putting GS well ahead of their competition. IDK what they did but it worked. Actually very solid development. GS has turned into a money-making machine. Can they keep it up? \n* **FB**: While figures are behind GS since 2023, they're reliably improving. \n* **BJK**: Growth similar-ish to FB, but on a smaller scale. I would however argue that for Besiktas, increasing revenues should be less of a target than cutting costs. \n\n\n\n# 4. Revenue-to-Liability Ratios\n\nThis ratio shows how much revenue supports total liabilities. Higher is better, as it reflects the club\u2019s ability to service its debt. A club that takes on debt without ability to earn is a little crazy and not in the hot way. \n\n|Year|GS|FB|BJK|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2021**|0.28|0.27|0.21|\n|**2022**|0.23|0.33|0.23|\n|**2023**|0.75|0.59|0.36|\n|**2024Q1**|0.13|0.10|0.11|\n\n**Trend**:\n\n* **Overall**: Very positive. All clubs are moving towards MORE stability. \n* **GS**: Significant improvement in 2023. Actually very solid development. What this ratio doesn't show well: they kinda mess up the number in Q1 2024 by taking on a LOT of new debt. \n* **FB**: While figures are behind GS since 2023, they're more reliably improving. FB is doing very OK!\n* **BJK**: The weakest link among the big 3 with the poorest trajectory. Nevertheless, the trajectory is positive and they understood the assignment. Reduce leverage, increase revenues relative to liabilities in order to achieve stability (and qualify for better refinancing). \n\n  \n\n\n# 5. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Assets\n\nOne last thing I want to highlight is the 3 clubs differences in long term vs short term assets. Short-term are Cash or what is called \"cash equivalents\" - things, that can be turned into cash quickly. Probably not Collector's Cards or Whiskey. \n\nLongterm assets take time to sell. Could be players, facilities, etc. I guess an island. Note that their valuation also carries more uncertainty. \n\nAs for how much short-term vs long-term is good, this is a VERY contentious topic. I'll leave that to you guys to decide. Sometimes you should invest all your cash equivalents and sometimes you should hold the money. So I'll skip judgment here.   \n\n\n|Year|GS (Short/Long)|FB (Short/Long)|BJK (Short/Long)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2021**|0.46B / 2.59B|3.33B / 0.28B|2.01B / 0.37B|\n|**2022**|1.98B / 3.46B|3.75B / 0.83B|2.25B / 0.71B|\n|**2023**|2.29B / 8.84B|5.34B / 2.99B|2.77B / 3.67B|\n|**2024Q1**|4.68B / 10.25B|8.07B / 4.48B|3.60B / 4.39B|\n\n**Trend**:\n\n* GS: Long-term assets dominate, limiting liquidity flexibility. Short-term assets improved significantly in Q1 2024 but we also saw short-term debt grow so that makes sense. How can GS be fine financially but not pay Koehn on time? Here is your answer. Much of GS' value is in the players, facilities, and presumably other investments. \n* FB: Relies heavily on short-term assets, giving better liquidity but weaker asset stability. Since 2023, a move towards more long-term assets is discernible. Should FB invest more rather than hold cash? You decide. \n* BJK: Somewhat in between both clubs in terms of asset distribution. To be fair, it's kinda hard for BJK to inject new cash right now. They're doing what they can. \n\n  \n\n\n# Summary / TLDR\n\nWhat are the numbers telling us about the financial state of our clubs? Important: note that the numbers are up to date until March 2024, so towards the end of last season.   \n\n\n* **Overall**: While yes, the record debt looks scary, actually all clubs are **MORE financially stable** than a year or two ago. We all have reason to relax and enjoy a little. The overall trend for all 3 is positive and aside from growth in short-term debt, I don't see any numbers that are looking worse than last year for any of our clubs. As much as we like to hate and fear-monger, we should acknowledge that all our clubs are run by professionals and the numbers prove it. \n\n\n\n* **Galatasaray**: Financially arguably in the healthiest position of the 3, particularly revenues are really developing well. Their Board needs to decide: gamble on buying players like Osimhen and potentially improve revenues even more or use the current trends to stabilize and deleverage. Given these numbers, I have a feeling that spending big to achieve European success is possible. One thing to note is that they will need to find a good time to convert some of their long-term assets into cash. Otherwise, no Osimhen - but also, otherwise, that short-term debt could become dangerous. I assume that this short-term debt has only risen since March 2024, as GS has paid big for Sara and Sallai. \n* **Fenerbah\u00e7e**: FB is in a solid financial position. They're steadily improving. However, they'll need to figure out ways to earn more money FAST, if they don't want to fall too far behind GS. This might be why this season saw record investments in Mourinho and En-Nesyri. We will see how those affect the financial statements but Fenerbahce does need their investments to pay off. Fener did have a massive sale with Ferdi on the plus side. On another positive note, Fener appears to be the most liquid of the big 3 and I wouldn't be surprised if a deeper financial analysis would show that Fener is the least likely to go bankrupt of all clubs. \n* **Be\u015fikta\u015f**: Kinda needs to focus on getting club finances in check. I'm surprised Immobile and Rafa happened tbh - I'm not sure how those two will have affected the financial outlook. We will have to wait for new numbers to be published. I personally expect 1 or 2 more difficult years ahead but nobody has been reducing their debt burden quite like you guys so kudos to professional management and turning the ship around! \n\n\n\nLook forward to your feedback guys!

        "title": "About GS and yellow cards ",
        "body": "Hey everyone, in the last season, a theory about GS being boosted by TFF by not receiving yellow cards became quite popular. I still see posts about this *FREQUENTLY* in certain subreddits, so I would like to share my thoughts on the topic. Feel free to agree or disagree but I think a discussion forum would be useful.\u00a0\n\nIn the following, I\u2019ll refer to stats and football from the 2023-2024 season, as we don\u2019t have a statistically meaningful number of games in this season yet. We can evaluate again at the end of this season. I will also directly contrast GS with its closest rival FB, because that\u2019s what is usually done when this topic is raised.\u00a0\n\n**So why did GS receive fewer cards per foul - than many others in general and FB specifically?**\n\nGS plays possession football with pressing high up front. Much more than FB. Offensive fouls receive significantly fewer cards than defensive ones because they\u2019re typically not tactical and not stopping (clear) goal chances. Unlike FB, GS was also almost never behind this season, which means there simply was less need or urgency for tactical fouls. Unlike FB, GS also had no \"incidence games\" like the FB games against Trabzon that were just wild. GS also does not have physically dominant players like FB does - so playing less physical football is to be expected. Therefore, FB having more yellows at the end of the season than GS is expected.\n\n**Is the GS statistic a unique anomaly?**\n\nDo we see similar stats with other dominant, possession football teams in the world? Yes - Liverpool had the *third fewest yellow cards* in the Premier League despite having the *third most fouls per game* as per fotmob data (2023/2024). Do we see similar discussions about Liverpool?\n\nEvery GS fans favorite team Young Boys had the *MOST* fouls per game in the Swiss league yet was *9th (out of 12) in yellow cards conceded*. In other leagues, you will see the most dominant team typically either committing the least fouls or committing a significant number of fouls but in every case with very few yellows. The opposite? I wouldn\u2019t know of a single league.\u00a0\n\nIn other words: the number of cards can EASILY be explained away by the type of fouls, the timing of the game at which they occur (i.e. in the lead, under pressure), and the domination of the games GS played. It is TYPICAL around the world for dominant teams to receive fewer yellows - it\u2019s very much in line with what we see in other leagues. This, by the way, also gives a very plausible, non-fanatic explanation for why GS receives so many more cards in Europe. The opponents are better. If a team dominates you, you resort to more physical football, make more fouls, and some of them will clearly be last attempts at stopping a player who otherwise has you beat. Thus..cards.\u00a0 *The sad truth is that GS isn\u2019t competitive in the CL*.\u00a0\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end here. Let\u2019s not forget that a foul call always means that the ball is taken away from you and given to the opponent. Thus, you being fouled, means you getting or retaining the ball. This brings me to the flip side of this argument nobody is talking about.\u00a0\n\n**Flip side to the coin: FB receives many more foul calls in their favor.**\n\nGS gets the *15th* (think about that!) least foul calls in their favor, despite having *most possession*. How does that make sense, who can explain this? You can literally (almost) only be fouled when you\u2019re in possession. And yet, referees believed that 14 teams in the super lig got fouled more than GS. And in direct contrast, guess who gets fouled the most? Exactly, FB. Throughout the season, no team got the ball handed to by the refs more than FB.\u00a0\n\nGS fans, throughout the season, were losing hair over how opponent players take the ball away from them by foul means and the referee does nothing. This statistic supports their claim. Yet, in certain forums I keep  on seeing comments like \"if this was a GS player, it would have been a foul\"?\n\nI don\u2019t believe in a TFF conspiracy. I just think that some refs may be swayed by home atmospheres, some may be biased, but most importantly, many are just incompetent and fall for player theatrics. I also believe that the difference in statistics of last year are mostly due to different styles of football (and football players).\n\nThe point I want to make is that people who only look look at the yellow cards and scream conspiracy not only misunderstand the meaning of this statistic, ignore (or never look up) the truth of what football looks like all around the world, but also cherry pick only the numbers that suit their cause. Please, stop.\u00a0\n\nSome of my sources below - feel free to help me find better sources or correct what I'm saying. :)\n\n[Fouls per match](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/71/stats/season/21459/teams/fk_foul_lost_team/team/8637/galatasaray-teams)\n\n[Yellow cards](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/71/stats/season/21459/teams/total_yel_card_team/team/8637/galatasaray-teams)\n\n[Liverpool fouls](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/47/stats/season/20720/teams/fk_foul_lost_team/team/8586)\n\n[Bayern fouls](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/54/stats/season/23794/teams/fk_foul_lost_team/team/9823/bayern-munchen-teams)\n\n[Young Boys fouls](https://www.fotmob.com/teams/10192/stats/young-boys/teams)\n\n[Fouls committed vs Fouls Drawn ](https://www.thepunterspage.com/fouls-stats/)",

If their fans would be on the board one of the biggest reasons why they have success (Gedson) wouldn\u2019t be in this team anymore and ao many more. \n\nTrabzon: let\u2019s burn the world. \n\nLike what I want to say is we can\u2019t control our feelings and cannot be patient or trust the process cause our emotions are controlling us. We are saying that our boards are making panic transfers or they are acting populist but we don\u2019t see that we are the main reason why they do what they are doing. \n\n\nWe fucking sold KEREM AKA THE WIZARD only cause of our shitty fans for peanuts in a world where all wingers who can just run straight ahead are worth 20m at least. \n\nWe need to calm down and give the things the time which they need but I am pretty sure that at the end of the season 2 out of the 3 big Istanbul teams will not have the same coach next year cause Second place is a failure and don\u2019t let me start with the third place. \n\nIt\u2019s just sad that we can\u2019t control our emotions and invest into the future.",

Still not good\n\nTuzlaspor - I mean the people that go to the games are passionate but they dont deserve S\u00fcperLig\n\nPendikspor - Now I lived in Pendik for a lot of time and I can easily say that Pendik folk love Pendikspor but the fans dont deserve S\u00fcperLig.\n\nKas\u0131mpa\u015fa - Same as Pendik, passionate but dont deserve S\u00fcperLig\n\nFatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck - Eternal rivals of Pendik. Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck folk are also passionate. Maybe they would be better if they had a Stadium there but still dont deserve S\u00fcperLig.\n\nBeykoz - Shame that they are in the S\u00fcper Amat\u00f6r Lig. Would deserve s\u00fcperlig if they had a better stadium but they are too violent.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e - They were better but not now. Still good for S\u00fcperLig.\n\nGalatasaray - One of the best tifos in the world are made bu Galatasaray fans. But the number one spot goes to\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f - Best percussion, best chants and best Stadium. Their tifos though even Altay is better in that topic.\n\nRemember, this is my subjective opinion and they are the ones that I witnessed. Tell me your opinions.",

        "body": "I noticed the sub skews younger, so I thought I'd share some of my experiences watching Turkish soccer in the late '80s and '90s that some of you might not have known and may find interesting. (Other elders like me, feel free to add.)\n\n(It should say things. Can't edit the title)\n\n\\*It became SuperLig in 2000. It was \"Birinci Lig\" before.\n\n\\*Almost all stadiums had fences separating the stands from the field. I think Fenerbahce was among the first to dismantle them after renovating the stadium around 2000.\n\n\\*Players were often referred to with first names. Many fans wouldn't even know the last names of players.\n\n\\*Players with the same name on the same team would be identified as \"B\u00fcy\u00fck\" or \"K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u201ddepending on their age. Latest example of this I remember was B\u00fcy\u00fck Hakan (Sukur) and K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hakan (Unsal). This fell out of fashion in late 1990s.\n\n\\*Until 2000-01 season, there were no assigned squad numbers. Starters wore numbers 1-11 and subs wore 12 to 16 (later to 18 when number of bench players available went from 5 to 7) with no names on the back. You may see the odd highlight reel of Hagi wearing number 15 or 17 because of that (when he entered as a sub.)\n\n\\*Reporters would literally jump in from sidelines during a game to do interviews. Some legendary moments came out of these interviews like Fenerbahce's Engin saying \"Hakem bana pezevenk dedi\" or Galatasaray's Hayrettin claiming he was going to \"end Ridvan\"\n\n  \n\\*Fenerbahce was the undisputed great of the league. Every celebrity, every major public figure, most sports journalists were Fener fans. In the movie Hababam Sinifi, writers made all the characters Fener fans, such was Fener's cultural dominance. Milliyet, the second or third biggest paper at the time, didn't have a single reporter who was a Galatasaray fan, their Galatasaray reporter was Halil Ozer, a well-known Fener supporter. Before Galatasaray's four in a row titles they had 10 to Fener's 13.\n\n\\*For evening games, PAF (Profesyonellige Aday Futbolcu) teams of the clubs would often play earlier in the day in the same field. I played against Galatasaray PAF as a member of Genclerbirligi PAF prior to a league game. Sabri was in the game and was playing as an attacking midfielder. \n\n\\*Many stadiums didn't have lighting well into early 2000s, teams had to play day games.\n\n\\*There was no assigned seating in most stadiums (or limited to \"numarali tribun\")\n\n\\*Kidnapping players to sign them was common (i.e. you'd get to the player first, make him sign a pre-contract and stash him away in a hotel somewhere so nobody else gets to him while you're negotiating with his team). There was also the \"h\u00fclle\" method of signing a guy -which involved having them fake sign with a Bulgarian team or something to get around paying compensation to his old team.\n\n\\*National team was so bad. So bad. An embarrassment. Up until qualifying for Euro 96, people would still recount beating the legendary Hungarian team in a friendly as the team's greatest success.",

I'd love to go to both matches if possible.\n\nThe tickets available are away supporters (Misafir) which I wouldn't do and some of the more expensive tickets starting in Category 5 (2,200 lira). The Category 5 tickets are on the sidelines in the 400 sections. \n\nAm I allowed to purchase tickets to this match in that category even though my Passolig card shows Fenerbah\u00e7e on the back? \n\nI didn't see any guidance on this anywhere, so figured I would ask. I could see it being an issue if you bought in the main supporters end or the away supporters, but I don't know about the rest of the stadium. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Not because he is a Galatasaray player; similar sources claimed 30 million was offered for Semih, but I also don't find that realistic at all. What I'm asking is, how much do you think BAY is worth, and for how much do you think he will be transferred (considering any Turkish player will get transferred for less than their actual value)?\n\nIn my opinion, he is a great player and was one of the key players in Euro 2024. He has strength, is fast, has an amazing work rate both offensively and defensively, can carry the ball, and doesn't lose it easily. However, I find his passing and crossing mediocre, and his shooting isn't the best either. Additionally, his technical ability and game sense/IQ seem to be lacking. Now, don't get me wrong, what I mean by 'lacking' is lacking for a 35 million player. Overall, I still think he is a great player and hope he becomes a top player in Europe.\n\nBack to the topic, I think he will get transferred for 20-30 million, and anything over 35 million seems unrealistic to me. What do you (especially Galatasaray fans) think?",

Honestly, it went under the radar, but what he did with them, taking them from dead last with 0 pts and no goals scored after 3-4 weeks, to finishing top 4 is a great achievement. Hopefully he takes European matches seriously. \n\nI\u2019m expecting Besiktas to be reinvigorated and compete for a championship next year and hopefully that transfers over to European success. \n\nWith Trabzon, Avci needs to actually care about Europe and hopefully they can have meaningful contribution to coefficient pts. \n\nObviously, *if* the teams can\u2019t qualify for their respective tournaments, next best option is for them to qualify for the group stage of the lower  tournament.

        "title": "The Relegation Battle",
        "body": "One thing that has gone under the radar this season in the S\u00fcper Lig is the relegation battle. Perhaps due to the fact there is such a big gap in quality between the top two and the rest of the league, it has meant that the other 18 clubs have managed to beat and lose to each other in equal measure throughout the season.\n\nWith four relegation spots, just \u0130stanbulspor have confirmed their relegation so far, and we could see a scenario where the other relegation spots are filled with teams ending the season on more than 40 points.\n\nThe following matches will be of interest today, all kicking-off at 7pm local time:\n\n*Samsunspor - Alanyaspor*\nSamsun look pretty safe on 42 points. Their opponents, Alanyaspor, are currently upper mid-table and have a very slim chance of making a 5th-place finish, which will offer Europe should Trabzonspor win the cup. A win tonight will secure Samsun\u2019s safety, a draw won\u2019t leave them feeling particularly comfortable, given their final game is Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck away, and should the two sides go level on points into that match, a win by two goals would see FKG rise above Samsun.\n\n*Kayserispor - Konyaspor*\nHad Kayseri not been deducted 3 points earlier in the season by the TFF, then they would already be safe. They instead have 41 points, just four more than FKG and Hatay, who occupy the top two spots in the relegation zone. A win today would see Kayserispor safe, but standing in their way is Konyaspor, just a position and a point below them in the table. \n\nFor Konya, beating Kayserispor today will be all the more important given their final game of the season is Galatasaray away. Galatasaray host Fenerbah\u00e7e on Sunday night, and should the away side win, Galatasaray must not lose to Konya at home to secure the title. Therefore, Konya will know they need to get the job done themselves tonight and will watch the derby tomorrow to see what kind of Galatasaray they will face in the final game of the season. \n\n*Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc - Pendikspor*\nAnother 6-pointer sees the capital club take on the Pendik, a team battling their way through their first-ever S\u00fcper Lig season. Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc haven\u2019t won in over a month, and with their final game of the season being Trabzon away, they will be aware of the necessity to get points on the board tonight.\n\nFor Pendik, things hang finely in the balance. After their trip to the capital, they face Gaziantep at home, which could end up as a relegation play-off depending on results elsewhere.\n\n*Gaziantep - Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck*\nThese two teams sit either side of the thin red line which decides between another season in the S\u00fcper Lig or a return to the 1 Lig. Given the closeness of the teams at the bottom and the fixtures next weekend, it looks unlikely that these two will end the season still sitting next to one another. Antep will be high on confidence after they smashed Adana Demirspor 6-1 away from home last weekend.\n\n*Be\u015fikta\u015f - Hatayspor*\nHatay became the latest team to swap managers at the start of the month, when they parted ways with Volkan Demirel, the former Fenerbah\u00e7e legend who had overseen them through one of the toughest times in their S\u00fcper Lig history. A trip to 5th-placed Be\u015fikta\u015f would, in any other season, be uneasily anticipated, but given BJK\u2019s topsy-turvy season, Hatay might rightly believe the points are their for the taking. \n\n\n",

Is it likely this will be sold out? Is there any way to check either of these things.\n\nIdeally I\u2019d like to sit in the home end, but I\u2019m willing to sit in the away stand and enjoy the atmosphere!

Ba\u015fak\u015fehir has also contributed, nothing too special but still pretty good in comparison to other clubs.\n\nThe biggest disappointments to be are Trabzonspor and Be\u015fikta\u015f. To have less points per season than Sivasspor, who have been working with an insanely thin squad every European season, is shameful if I'm honest. The others have also been underperforming however they have lower expectations and have faced tough opponents in qualifier knockouts. Alanyaspor's loss to Rosenborg (1-0 away), Malatyaspor's loss to Partizan and Adana Demirspor's loss to Genk (penalties) are commendable. Konyaspor's disappointment vs Vaduz is inexcusable though, that is a horrible stain on our coefficient.\n\nMy point is, if we want this league to actually perform and keep improving, then we need to face the realities and everyone needs to pull their weight regarding the coefficient. I will say I also personally place blame on one manager who has consistently underperformed as well, Abdullah Avc\u0131. I have never been comfortable knowing he's on the bench for a European game, he underperformed while managing Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and kept that up through managing Be\u015fikta\u015f and Trabzonspor. If Trabzonspor finish 3rd, they should look into the option of having 2 managers and rotate between them in Europe and the league^(/s but not really).\n\nHere's to hoping for another relatively successful season in Europe, and it will be a fun watch seeing how the final few weeks play out (competition for the 4th and 5th spot is looking very interesting).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Graph basically shows everything according to points per season\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ry9f46okwbvc1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37bf187b52bb62cc85b984ac5dc217449b710f2c\n\n**All data from** [here](https://www.football-coefficient.eu/country/10-tuerkiye/).

The **delusion** of how big our teams are way out of hand. \n\nThe objective reality is, no matter how much you love and worship your team, the big teams of Turkey are big in their amount of fans, and people's love for them, NOT big in their status in international football. It is pure delusion that vast majority of Turkish football fans think having a squad like any Greek, Russian , Swiss or Scottish team is \"not our level\" despite our teams for decades being literally that level.\n\nAnd I think only way to really hammer this to people's brain in Turkey, would be a team like Basak-city, with new City group agreement, dominating the league over and over with squad that individually much less \"fancy\" than big teams.\n\nWe already had a good preview of this in last 5-6 years, that Basaksehir always had half the squad value of Big teams, and always competed with them in league table , often won over (always finishing atleast over 1 of the bigs, despite not being champions).\n\nI think only hope for saving Turkish football, is such club hammering to the mind of people over and over for several years, that you can win leagues without expensive and fancy signing , in a league as low as Turkish league.",

The objective being to compare and contrast and understand those that are at the extremes for financial stability, etc.\n\nWe would like to include as many Super Lig clubs as possible - but at least the clubs that represented Turkey in UEFA this year (Fenerbah\u00e7e, Galatasaray, Besiktas, Adana Demirspor).  \n\nFootball Benchmark published a tweet / X recently ([https://twitter.com/Football\\_BM/status/1733029375707136134](https://twitter.com/Football_BM/status/1733029375707136134)) which included some good details for 3 of the 4 (sorry Adana Demirspor!) and also Trabzonspor.  However, it didn't cover all clubs, and didn't include their cash position.\n\nI was hoping that this sub-reddit may be able to help!\n\nDo Turkish clubs have to publish their financial statements to a central government registry? If so, are the results available to the public? Or is there somewhere else I can get the information (e.g. the Austrian federation publishes a summary report with all the clubs' details from Bundesliga 1 and 2).\n\nThank you very much for reading and for any help that you can provide.",

        "title": "A Different Take on The Events in Trabzon",
        "body": " As a Fenerbah\u00e7e fan I couldn't stop thinking about the events that happened both during and after the game with Trabzonspor. They deeply affected me, so I wanted to create this post to share some of my thoughts and also to hear about yours.\n\nI believe there are two points of view in this situation:\n\n**(1) From the Perspective of a Fenerbah\u00e7e Official:**\n\nIn this part, I will analyze the events by asking, \"How would I act if I were an official on the team?\" Before making a judgement on the ideas in this part, I suggest you consider that the sole objective of an official on the team is to win the game and keep the players safe.\n\nFrom the beginning and until the end of the first half, everything was nearly perfect. We were leading the game 2-0. The external attempts to escalate tension were unsuccessful (e.g., throwing objects at Ismail Kartal and the bench), and our players remained as calm as they could.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning the actions of Mert Hakan and Irfan Can Egribayat. I believe that their behavior wasn't wrong; the banter they engaged in is definitely a part of the game. BUT, in an environment where fans were just looking for an opportunity to raise the tension, what they did was not in the team's best interest. I think any increase in tension would be bad for the team since it would shift the focus onto us instead of highlighting how poorly Trabzonspor was playing. However, these acts cannot justify or be the reason for what the Trabzonspor fans did.\n\nWith the start of the second half, things began to escalate. Trabzonspor fans started to throw water bottles and who knows what else at the players, especially towards our left wing in a large scale. This position is very important because we were primarily building the game from our left wing. Both our goals came with assists from that area.\n\nAs people began to throw more and more, we were unable to play our game due to external interference. Thus, the game began to shift towards Trabzonspor. I think with the fireworks landing just seconds before we conceded the first goal, it was obvious that the situation had nothing to do with football. At that point, if I were a Fenerbah\u00e7e official and saw that the referee had no intention or power to stop the game, I would have taken the team off the pitch. This was one of the main mistakes our team made that day. It was clear that there was no environment suitable for playing football.\n\nMoving to the final whistle and celebrations, again, from a Fenerbah\u00e7e official's perspective, I would not have allowed my players to stay one more second in that place. Guys, there were very few police officers there. My first priority is the well-being of my players. Considering the mentality of the people in the stadium, I believe it was very dangerous to celebrate there. And with the events that occurred after fans entered the pitch, I deeply regret allowing the players to celebrate on the pitch. What would have happened to the team if one of our players had been stabbed or worse? It's a miracle that all of our players made it out safely. As Ali Ko\u00e7 mentioned in his speech, healing the traumas experienced by our players is very difficult. I think Osayi was not very happy to have to fend off 10 guys in a row. These players have families and kids. The technical team should not have taken this risk.\n\nI believe these are the main mistakes our team made, when we focus on the club's best interest. The criticisms I've mentioned are not about anyone else; they are about us. By making these criticisms, I am simply focusing on our success in the future.\n\n**(2) From the Perspective of a Football Fan:**\n\nIn this part, I'll be analyzing the events from the perspective of a football fan, not specifically a Fenerbah\u00e7e fan. I'll try to be as objective and conscientious as possible.\n\nFirst of all, compared to other stadiums, why are there no police officers there? I really can't understand this. It's so obvious that there have been tensions between these teams for nearly 30 years, especially considering the events that occurred during previous games. A referee was beaten up, many dangerous objects were thrown at Volkan Demirel, many games were left unfinished, and more. Considering these, the security precautions taken at the game make me very angry. I've been to many Fenerbah\u00e7e matches in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and experienced many instances where I wasn't allowed to bring a single plastic bottle into the stadium. Now, how could the Trabzon fans not be stopped from bringing those objects into the stadium? The inadequacy of security is, I believe, the most crucial aspect of the events because no one should experience a life threat at a football game in Turkey.\n\nFurthermore, every team has the right to celebrate on the field under the terms of football. The players didn't commit a crime by celebrating on the pitch. It is in no way a reason for someone to jump onto the pitch and attack the players. Trabzonspor celebrated, and the Galatasaray team celebrated after winning the cup in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y. To demonstrate my objectivity, some of you may disagree, but I did not approve of the fans' actions in 2012 either. Some of you may argue that external influences triggered the fans in 2012, which is true, but my point is EVERY team can celebrate anywhere. This is just a game, not a war. I can't understand the hatred people harbor against each other in this context. Sometimes we even show unnecessary aggression towards others. This completely diminishes the joy and pleasure we derive from football.\n\nSo, looking at the big picture, there is no security, no safety for players on both sides, and there is pure chaos. Under these conditions, you cannot judge a player for their actions. Imagine a guy with a weird mask jumping onto the pitch and running at you. None of us can understand the psychology of a football player in that situation. It's meaningless to say 'Players should have done this.' Yes, the image of players beating fans may seem disturbing, but you can't expect people to act logically under those chaotic conditions. I really believe this because what do you think other fans would say if this happened to their team? They'd be making the same arguments, boasting about how their player beat rival fans. So, we shouldn't focus on the players' actions. No one should expect a football player to act logically in pure chaos. People should focus on how things reached this point in the first place. How come there were no police officers to stop fans from throwing so many objects or jumping onto the pitch?\n\nThese are my thoughts on the events. I must also say that I am ultimately proud of my team and how they handled the situation. Not every team would have acted so bravely. I really appreciate the character our team showed. What are your thoughts?",

However, most of that is due to their heavy losses against the Istanbul big 3. \n\nGalatasaray and Fenerbahce are truly in a league of their own this year. Hopefully with proper adjustments and reinforcements, both TS &amp; BJK, as well as the other gritty Anadolu teams will increase the competition next season. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Find anything else interesting? ",

If not is it possible to change? And when do they go on sale? I cannot find this info anywhere\n\n",

I\u2019ve bought tickets to see Galatasaray on Fri 8th March, and have also paid for a passolig card to be delivered to the stadium. \n\nI\u2019m trying to login to the Passomobil app so that I can access my ticket, but after it sends the verification code I never receive it, have tried multiple times, restarting my phone, no luck. Luckily it works fine on the website and the code comes through weirdly. Anyone know how I can fix this? Or is there a way to enter the stadium without using the app?\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nHoping to get this sorted hopefully haven\u2019t wasted my money:)",

I generally get through 12-15 movies a trimester, depending on how the class is.\n\nSo, I am looking for suggestions on films I can show. The beauty of this class is that it is for High Schoolers, and they have to sign waivers that they may watch r-rated or more \"serious\" movies.\n\nBelow is a list of movies I generally use right now. Really, any suggestions need to be historical/war based, and no longer than 3 hours, but inaccurate yet fun movies are welcome. The second beauty of the class is that we often discuss the inaccuracy of films and if films are a healthy medium for learning history.\n\nLastly, please no Holocaust suggestions. A fellow teacher actually teaches a holocaust class, and I have much more freedom in what I show so I don't like to encroach on what they have available \n\nI appreciate any help in advance \n\nLast years movies:\n\nGladiator\n\nBraveheart\n\nCrucible\n\nThe Patriot\n\nAmistad\n\nGlory\n\nDances with wolves\n\n8 men out\n\nGallipoli\n\nThe Untouchables\n\nDunkirk\n\nAmerican Graffiti \n\n13 Days\n\n",
